# DoYourJob
 Do Your Job is a survival game? job simulation?... its a thing i slapped together in under a month. It started off with an idea I worked on with a friend for a game jam that we didn't finish in time because of other responsibilities that I decided to extend into a more finished thing.
 
You are at a new job, the company is great, u love it here, everything is lovely :) People totally don't yell at you, things are absolutely not falling apart for systemic reasons, you are defiantly not over worked and most importantly you are happy!.
